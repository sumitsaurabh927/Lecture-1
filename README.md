This is a quiz app I created during level 0 of neogcamp. It is a CLI app for people to see how well they know our flag. You will find the link to play the game below:

I've used the following packages to make the app a bit fancier:
- Readline-Sync - [npm link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync)
- Chalk - [npm link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
